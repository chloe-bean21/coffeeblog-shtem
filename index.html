        <h1>Deconstructing the Cortado</h1>
        <p>by Chloe Hong</p>

        <p>
            My dad and I make coffee together almost every morning. 
            Recently, I have been making him coffee and experimenting with different drinks.
            Out of all the types of drinks I have made, the cortado remains my favorite - it is balanced, smooth, and not diluted.
            Here is a breakdown of the process, so that you can experiment on your own!

        </p>
    </section>

    <!--what is cortado-->
    <section>
        <h2>What actually is a cortado?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The cortado originated in Spain. The Spanish word "cortar" means "to cut", describing the way the milk "cuts" into the acidity of the espresso.</li>
            <li>The drink is often served in a 4-5 oz metal or glass cup.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!--how to make it-->
    <section>
        <h2>How to make a great cortado</h2>
        <p>
            The cortado is deceptively simple; it only requires espresso and steamed milk. 
            However, making a great shot of espresso and steaming your milk perfectly are both challenging tasks.
        </p>
        
        <!--espresso section-->

        <h3>The first part: Espresso</h3>

            <!--beans section-->
            <h4 class="dropdown-btn">Beans ▼</h4>
            <section class="dropdown">
            
                <p>
                    Choosing the right beans takes time, as you will need to explore your roast and flavor preferences.
                </p>
                <h5>1. Find a coffee flavor and roast you like.</h5>
                <p>
                    
                    Finding your favorite flavor profile is arguably the hardest step - there is so much to choose from. In general there are four main groups of coffee flavors: fruity, nutty, chocolatey, and floral. If you like peanut butter, for example, you may reach for a nuttier profile. 
                    <br>
                    Below is the flavor wheel developed by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) [1]. It summarizes the most common coffee flavor profiles. 
    
                </p>
                <img src="flavor wheel.jpg" alt="flavor wheel">
                <p>
                    The roast type also determines the flavor profile. There are three levels of roasts.
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Light roast: roasted until a single crack is heard. More caffeine, bright and floral flavor [2]</li>
                        <li>Medium roast: roasted until just before the second crack. Thick, balanced flavor, medium caffeine</li>
                        <li>Dark roast: roasted until the end of the second crack. Bold, smoky, full bodied </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    One way to explore different flavors and roasts is to go to specialty cafes. They often offer different types of beans instead of just a singular house blend.
                </p>

                <h5>2. Buy your beans!</h5>
                <p>
                    Once you find your preference, buy your beans. 

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p style="font-weight:bold;">Some tips</p>
                    <li>Make sure you buy them fresh (1-2 weeks after roasting date). As the beans age, they oxidize, lose flavor, and become stale. </li>
                    <li>The beans' natural flavors are influenced by their soil composition, climate, altitude, and processing methods. For example, Hawaiian Kona coffee is grown on Mauna Koa, so it has a distinct smoky flavor [3]. </li>
                    <li>Support small businesses and local roasters! Whole Foods is a good second option.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, my dad likes chocolate and floral flavors. 
                    I bought Bella Donovan by Blue Bottle Coffee, which is a natural light-medium roast with raspberry and chocolate notes. The profile is sweet, round, and very buzzy.
                    Below is a latte I made with Bella Donovan!</p>

            <!--tools and extraction-->

            <h4 class="dropdown-btn">Tools and extraction methods ▼</h4>
            <section class="dropdown">
            
                    <p>Buying the right tools is very easy. There is a slight curve to learning the techniques but if you make coffee every day, you will improve very quickly.</p>
                <h5>1. Extraction methods</h5>
                    <p>Most people use a moka pot or an espresso machine to make espresso. The moka pot is easier to learn but less convenient. The espresso machine is more convenient but trickier to learn. To each their own! I use a Breville Bambino machine.</p>
                <h5>2. Tools needed</h5>
                    <p>Besides the extraction device, you need:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A tamper, which pushes the grounds down</li>
                        <li>A cup, 4-5 oz</li>
                        <li>Coffee scale that measures by 0.1 g</li>
                        <li>A portafilter, which holds the grounds</li>
                        <li>A coffee grinder</li>
        
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../tools.jpg" alt="tools">
                <h5>3. Basic walkthrough to using an espresso machine</h5>
                    <p>An espresso machine pushes hot pressurized water through a compact puck of ground coffee. The high pressure creates the "crema", or the white layer on top of the espresso. The crema contains the natural oils of the beans. This makes grind size, compactness, and timing the three most important parts of making espresso.</p>
                    <img src="../Screenshot 2026-01-30 130410.png" alt="diagram">
                    <ul>
                        
                            <li>Grind size: this directly affects the acidity of your shot. Rule of thumb - the lighter the roast, the finer the grind. </li>
                            <li>Grind amount: this is the weight of the beans. You just need to make sure it all fits in the portafilter!</li>
                            <li>Compactness: tamp the grinds down evenly. </li>
                            <li>Timing ratio: rule of thumb is 1:2:30. 
                                <br>
                                That means for every gram of coffee grounds, there should be 2 grams of liquid. You should reach that number at around 30 seconds.</li>
                            <li>Taste: finally you can try your coffee! This part is the most important - find what you like and adjust from there.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Milk is steamed using a steam wand, which not only heats the milk but also incorporates air.</p>
                <p>The steam breaks the surface tension of the milk so that air can be incorporated. This makes our microfoam, which are super tiny air bubbles. </p>
                <p>As the milk warms, its whey and casein proteins wrap around the bubbles. One side of the protein is hydrophobic (water repellent). This side will wrap around the bubbles. The other side is hydrophilic, or attracted to water, so it will cling to the water in the milk. Milks with a higher protein content tend to develop foam better [4]. </p>
                <p>If the milk becomes too hot, its proteins denature and the foam structure eventually collapses [5]. Overheated milk tastes burnt and flat.</p>

                <ul>
                
                    <li>For a cortado, pour around 4-5 oz of milk into your pitcher.</li>
                    <li>Purge your steam wand by allowing steam to come out for a few seconds.</li>
                    <li>Angle the pitcher so that the wand is around a 90 degree angle from the spout.</li>
                    <li>For the first 5-6 seconds, allow the wand to touch the surface of the milk. This creates air and large bubbles. It should sound like paper ripping.</li>
                    <li>Lower the wand when you have reached the desired amount of foam.</li>
                    <li>Angle the pitcher more harshly to create a whirlpool effect, which breaks down the bubbles and incorporates the foam into the milk.</li>
                    <li>When the pitcher is just too hot, stop the steam flow and purge the wand again. Then make your latte art!</li>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Making cortados has helped me to notice the small details. A minor change to my preparation method can greatly impact the taste of the coffee. I have learned to be more patient and meticulous when making coffee. These skills have helped me improve in my other hobbies, such as cybersecurity and playing the cello. I hope to continue to grow in my patience and technical skills at SHTEM!
